Unlike other BI technologies, predictive analytics is forward-looking, using past events to anticipate the future. Predictive analytics statistical techniques include data modeling, machine learning, AI, deep learning algorithms and data mining. Often the unknown event of interest is in the future, but predictive analytics can be applied to any type of unknown whether it be in the past, present or future. For example, identifying suspects after a crime has been committed, or credit card fraud as it occurs. The core of predictive analytics relies on capturing relationships between explanatory variables and the predicted variables from past occurrences, and exploiting them to predict the unknown outcome. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy and usability of results will depend greatly on the level of data analysis and the quality of assumptions.\\nPredictive analytics is often defined as predicting at a more detailed level of granularity, i.e., generating predictive scores (probabilities) for each individual organizational element. This distinguishes it from forecasting. For example, \"Predictive analytics—Technology that learns from experience (data) to predict the future behavior of individuals in order to drive better decisions.\" In future industrial systems, the value of predictive analytics will be to predict and prevent potential issues to achieve near-zero break-down and further be integrated into prescriptive analytics for decision optimization.\\n\\n\\n== Analytical techniques ==\\nThe approaches and techniques used to conduct predictive analytics can broadly be grouped into regression techniques and machine learning techniques.\\n\\n\\n=== Machine Learning ===\\n\\nMachine learning can be defined as the ability of a machine to learn and then mimic human behavior that requires intelligence. This is accomplished through artificial intelligence, algorithms, and models.\\n\\n\\n=== Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) ===\\n\\nARIMA models are a common example of time series models. These models use autoregression, which means the model can be fitted with a regression software that will use machine learning to do most of the regression analysis and smoothing. ARIMA models are known to have no overall trend, but instead have a variation around the average that has a constant amplitude, resulting in statistically similar time patterns.

By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data. According to IDC, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021. While Statista report, the global big data market is forecasted to grow to $103 billion by 2027. In 2011 McKinsey & Company reported, if US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value every year. In the developed economies of Europe, government administrators could save more than €100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data. And users of services enabled by personal-location data could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.\\nRelational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data. The processing and analysis of big data may require \"massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers\". What qualifies as \"big data\" varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools. Furthermore, expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. \"For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration.\"', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data'}, page_content='Big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many entries (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate. Though used sometimes loosely partly due to a lack of formal definition, the best interpretation is that it is a large body of information that cannot be comprehended when used in small amounts only.\\nBig data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity. The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization\\'s capacity to create and capture value from big data.\\nCurrent usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. \"There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that\\'s not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem.\"\\nAnalysis of data sets can find new correlations to \"spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on\". Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics, connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology, and environmental research.\\nThe size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices, cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices, aerial (remote sensing) equipment, software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.

Unlike other BI technologies, predictive analytics is forward-looking, using past events to anticipate the future. Predictive analytics statistical techniques include data modeling, machine learning, AI, deep learning algorithms and data mining. Often the unknown event of interest is in the future, but predictive analytics can be applied to any type of unknown whether it be in the past, present or future. For example, identifying suspects after a crime has been committed, or credit card fraud as it occurs. The core of predictive analytics relies on capturing relationships between explanatory variables and the predicted variables from past occurrences, and exploiting them to predict the unknown outcome. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy and usability of results will depend greatly on the level of data analysis and the quality of assumptions.\\nPredictive analytics is often defined as predicting at a more detailed level of granularity, i.e., generating predictive scores (probabilities) for each individual organizational element. This distinguishes it from forecasting. For example, \"Predictive analytics—Technology that learns from experience (data) to predict the future behavior of individuals in order to drive better decisions.\" In future industrial systems, the value of predictive analytics will be to predict and prevent potential issues to achieve near-zero break-down and further be integrated into prescriptive analytics for decision optimization.\\n\\n\\n== Analytical techniques ==\\nThe approaches and techniques used to conduct predictive analytics can broadly be grouped into regression techniques and machine learning techniques.\\n\\n\\n=== Machine Learning ===\\n\\nMachine learning can be defined as the ability of a machine to learn and then mimic human behavior that requires intelligence. This is accomplished through artificial intelligence, algorithms, and models.\\n\\n\\n=== Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) ===\\n\\nARIMA models are a common example of time series models. These models use autoregression, which means the model can be fitted with a regression software that will use machine learning to do most of the regression analysis and smoothing. ARIMA models are known to have no overall trend, but instead have a variation around the average that has a constant amplitude, resulting in statistically similar time patterns.

      "That's a great question! Before pushing any data analysis model or system to production, you should conduct a thorough battery of tests to ensure accuracy, reliability, and robustness. Here's a breakdown of essential tests:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Unit Tests:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Individual Component Testing:**  Test each piece of your code (functions, modules) in isolation to ensure they perform as expected. \n",
      "* **Data Validation:** Verify that your code correctly handles different data types, formats, and edge cases (e.g., missing values, outliers).\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Integration Tests:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **System-Level Testing:** Test how different parts of your system work together. For example, if you have data processing, modeling, and visualization components, test their interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Performance Tests:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Load Testing:**  Simulate a high volume of user requests or data processing to ensure your system can handle peak loads without crashing or degrading performance.\n",
      "* **Stress Testing:** Push your system beyond its normal limits to identify breaking points and potential bottlenecks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Regression Tests:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Maintain Existing Functionality:**  After making changes, run regression tests to ensure that existing features still work correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Data Quality Tests:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Accuracy:**  Verify that your model outputs are accurate and consistent with expected results.\n",
      "* **Completeness:**  Ensure that all necessary data is being processed and used by the model.\n",
      "* **Timeliness:**  Test that data is being updated and used in a timely manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Security Tests:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Data Protection:**  Test your system's ability to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or breaches.\n",
      "* **Authentication:** Ensure that users are properly authenticated before accessing data or functionalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Real-World Feedback:** Have end-users test your system in a real-world scenario to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Test Data:** Use representative test data that covers a wide range of scenarios.\n",
