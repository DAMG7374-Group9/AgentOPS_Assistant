Kishore (Manager):
Good morning, everyone! Hope you’re all doing well. Today’s meeting is primarily about project progress, the issues you’re facing, and any deliverables for the week. Let’s dive right in. Darshit, could you start by giving us an overview?

Darshit (Lead):
Absolutely, Kishore. So far, we’ve made good progress on the user engagement dashboard, but we’ve hit a few bottlenecks. The real-time data ingestion pipeline is functioning well, but we're facing some challenges with the data aggregation, especially when the load spikes. Gopi has been leading the charge on that.

Kishore (Manager):
Thanks, Darshit. Gopi, can you elaborate on the issues with the aggregation process?

Gopi (Senior Data Analyst):
Sure, Kishore. The core issue lies in the fact that our data volume has increased significantly over the last month. During peak hours, the aggregation process, which calculates daily active users and engagement metrics, is taking far longer than expected. We’ve optimized the SQL queries and moved some calculations to pre-computed views, but we’re still experiencing delays. One of the potential solutions is shifting some processing to our Snowflake warehouse using DBT, but it’s going to take some time to restructure that.

Elon (VP, BI Team):
Interesting point, Gopi. Could this be a resource issue? Are we hitting our memory limits, or is it purely about optimizing the query structure?

Gopi (Senior Data Analyst):
It’s a mix of both, Elon. We’ve definitely noticed high resource consumption during peak times, and while optimizing queries has helped reduce some load, we might need to consider upgrading our Snowflake clusters. But before that, we’re trying to push more of the computation to off-peak hours.

Darshit (Lead):
Right, and I think one of the key things we’re still evaluating is whether we can reduce some of the redundant data we’re pulling. Akilesh and Riya, you’ve been working closely on this. Could you share your thoughts on the data load?

Akilesh (Junior Data Analyst):
Yeah, we’ve identified some datasets that are being pulled multiple times unnecessarily, particularly in our ETL process. We’ve started working on de-duplicating these datasets by modifying the pipeline, but we’re in the testing phase. One of the bigger issues we’re tackling is data integrity across different sources.

Riya (Junior Data Analyst):
Exactly. Some of the datasets we’re receiving are slightly inconsistent, especially when comparing transactional data from Salesforce and user engagement data from our app. There’s a mismatch in timestamps that throws off some of our metrics. We’re trying to adjust our ETL jobs to ensure consistent timestamps across the datasets.

Kishore (Manager):
Good catch, Riya. It’s crucial that the data we’re working with is consistent across the board. How long do you estimate the ETL fixes will take?

Riya (Junior Data Analyst):
We’ve already fixed the majority of issues in the test environment, but we need a few more days to ensure everything is stable before pushing it to production. I’d estimate by mid-next week.

Elon (VP, BI Team):
That’s great progress. Consistency is key, especially since our dashboards and reports depend on accurate, real-time data. Kishore, how do you see this impacting our upcoming deliverables?

Kishore (Manager):
Good question. Darshit, what’s the status of the current deliverables? Are we on track for the end-of-week reporting for the executive team?

Darshit (Lead):
For the most part, yes. We’re on track with the weekly KPIs, but the real-time dashboards for user engagement are delayed because of the data processing issues. Gopi and I are working on mitigating that. We should be able to provide a preliminary dashboard to the execs by Friday, but it won’t be fully optimized until we resolve the aggregation delays.

Kishore (Manager):
Okay, let’s plan for that. Elon, do you think the execs will be okay with a preliminary version?

Elon (VP, BI Team):
They’re always pushing for more, but as long as we give them something actionable, they’ll be fine. What’s important is that we’re transparent about the issues and our progress. Make sure the preliminary version clearly indicates areas that may still need optimization.

Gopi (Senior Data Analyst):
Noted. We’ll make sure to highlight any metrics that might still be lagging due to aggregation issues.

Kishore (Manager):
Thanks, Gopi. Let’s shift gears a bit. Akilesh, Riya, how are things going on your side with the client churn analysis? That’s another critical deliverable for this week.

Akilesh (Junior Data Analyst):
We’ve made significant progress. We’ve implemented the initial machine learning models to predict churn. The accuracy is at 85% based on historical data. However, we’re still refining the features to improve that. One challenge we’re facing is identifying the right features from Salesforce that correlate strongly with churn. We’ve pulled basic customer engagement metrics, but we feel there’s more data we can tap into.

Riya (Junior Data Analyst):
Yes, we’ve also found that payment history and user support ticket data are providing interesting insights into churn behavior. However, we’re not sure if we should include them in our models yet as we’re still testing their impact on the overall accuracy.

Kishore (Manager):
That’s promising. Gopi, could you give them some guidance on how to prioritize features for the model?

Gopi (Senior Data Analyst):
Sure. I’d suggest running correlation tests on the new features you’re pulling in to see which ones have the strongest correlation with churn. Also, it might be worth conducting feature importance analysis using techniques like SHAP values to identify which features are really driving the model’s predictions. That way, you can focus on the most impactful features and drop the rest.

Akilesh (Junior Data Analyst):
Great suggestion, Gopi. We’ll look into that. I think incorporating SHAP values will give us better clarity on which features matter most.

Riya (Junior Data Analyst):
Yes, that would streamline the model and give us more confidence in the outputs.

Elon (VP, BI Team):
Nice to see the junior team actively involved in the modeling process. Keep refining it, and remember that the insights from this churn model will be key for our customer retention strategy. We’ll need an executive summary of the analysis, so let’s aim to have that by the end of next week.

Kishore (Manager):
Absolutely, Elon. Darshit, could you coordinate with Akilesh and Riya on this and ensure that the executive summary is aligned with the company’s goals?

Darshit (Lead):
Will do, Kishore. We’ll meet later this week to consolidate the findings and create a polished report.

Kishore (Manager):
Perfect. Before we wrap up, does anyone have any other blockers or issues we should address?

Akilesh (Junior Data Analyst):
No blockers on my end, but I wanted to mention that we’re still tweaking the real-time alerts system for data anomalies. We’ve set up some alerts for outliers in the user engagement data, but the false-positive rate is high.

Gopi (Senior Data Analyst):
Good point. I can help with that as well. Let’s fine-tune the thresholds for those alerts and perhaps add some more filtering to reduce noise. We want to avoid alert fatigue among the team.

Riya (Junior Data Analyst):
Thanks, Gopi. That would be really helpful.

Kishore (Manager):
Great teamwork, everyone. Sounds like we’re making good progress despite a few challenges. Let’s stick to our deadlines and work together to resolve the remaining issues. Darshit, I trust you’ll keep me updated on any major developments.

Darshit (Lead):
Absolutely. I’ll share daily updates as we approach the end of the week.

Kishore (Manager):
Perfect. Thanks, everyone. Let’s reconvene next week to check on progress. Have a productive rest of the day!
